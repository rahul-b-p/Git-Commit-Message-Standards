# Git Commit Message Standards

A well-structured commit message helps maintain clarity and consistency in the codebase, making it easier for collaborators to understand changes. This guide outlines the standards for writing effective Git commit messages.

## **Commit Message Structure**

Each commit message consists of three parts:
1. **Header** (Mandatory)
2. **Body** (Optional)
3. **Footer** (Optional)

---

### **1. Header**
The header summarizes the change in a single line. It follows the format:  


#### **Types**
| Type        | Description                                                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **feat**    | A new feature.                                                |
| **fix**     | A bug fix.                                                    |
| **docs**    | Documentation updates or changes.                             |
| **style**   | Code formatting (does not affect functionality).              |
| **refactor**| Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.         |
| **perf**    | Code changes that improve performance.                        |
| **test**    | Adding or updating tests.                                     |
| **chore**   | Maintenance tasks (e.g., build process, dependency updates).  |
| **ci**      | Continuous Integration changes.                               |

#### **Examples**
- `feat: Add API to update office data`
- `fix: Resolve crash when updating office details`
- `docs: Update README with API usage details`

---

### **2. Body**
The body provides more details about the change, explaining **what** was done and **why**. Wrap text at 72 characters for better readability.

#### Example:

feat: Add API to update office data

    Added validation for address and location fields to ensure accuracy.
    Updated error handling to return meaningful messages for missing fields.
    Included logic to check changes in address fields and auto-update coordinates.
    This feature helps improve user experience by reducing manual effort.


---

### **3. Footer**
The footer is optional and used to reference issues, pull requests, or breaking changes.

#### Example:

fix: Resolve crash when updating office details

Closes #123

If thereâ€™s a breaking change, include:

---

## **Best Practices**
1. **Use the imperative mood**: Write as if giving a command (e.g., "Add" instead of "Added" or "Adds").
2. **Keep it concise**: Limit the header to 50 characters and the body to 72 characters per line.
3. **Explain the why**: Use the body to explain the reasoning behind the change.
4. **Reference related issues or tasks**: Use keywords like `Closes #<issue-number>` to link commits with issue trackers.

---

By following these standards, commit messages become meaningful and provide clear context for every change in the project.
